title: Task scheduling taxonomy
tldr: "Introduction to the general problem of scheduling a set of tasks on a uniprocessor system. Objectives, performance metrics, and hypotheses are clearly presented, and the scheduling problem is precisely formalized. The different algorithms proposed in the literature are then classified in a taxonomy, which provides a useful reference framework for understanding the different approaches."
